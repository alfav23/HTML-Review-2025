    <h1>General Overview</h1>
        <p>There is no "top" to the World-Wide Web. You can look at it from many points of view. 
            If you have no other bias, here are some ways of looking for information. <br>
            by Subject <br>
            A classification by subject of interest. Incomplete but easiest to use. <br>
            by Type <br>
            <p>Looking by type of service (access protocol, etc) may allow to find things if you know what you are looking for. </p>
            <p>If you have to use a "top" node, we recommend either this node or the subject list. See also: About the W3 project.</p>
